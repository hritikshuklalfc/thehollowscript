      <h1>The Choir</h1>
      <h2>from strangers to harmony, to silence.</h2>

      <div class="poem-content" style="margin-top: 50px">
        <p>
          One day I entered the class; that time I was already late, But that
          day I got to see your eyes, and decided you’ll be my fate…
        </p>

        <p class="secret-note">
          That version of me had no idea how to talk to you, So I learned to
          stalk you… I stalked you, again and again, until you noticed, Then for
          the first time, our eyes locked and my mind floated…
        </p>

        <p>
          And I remember getting to know your name indirectly for the first
          time, After that I was forced by my friend to express myself to you, I
          stammered and shook but still talked with you… I don’t know what I
          should call that; I call that true love, what about you?
        </p>

        <p>
          Then we started talking for hours and hours, We transformed from
          complete strangers to a beautiful choir…
        </p>

        <div class="the-break">THE SILENCE</div>

        <p>
          But one day the tables turned, and we started having fights… And due
          to that, we both had worse nights… As the touch decreased, we drifted
          away from each other… But along the way, we forgot that we were meant
          for each other…
        </p>

        <p>
          In the end, everything came to a stop; you confessed to me, to end… I
          quietly agreed ’cause I didn’t have any choice, Keeping you meant
          losing myself, and losing you meant losing the love of my life,
        </p>

        >
          The choir broke, and so did I…
        </p>

        <p>
          Now you are free from me, Don’t know about you, but I still think
          about it…
          <span class="golden-memory"
            >How golden it was, to be together and enjoy the talk…</span
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          Nowadays I see hatred in your eyes… And now truly the choir has been
          burnt and we are truly apart… You will always be in my memory, always
          with good regards… But that scar isn’t repairable, the one within my
          heart…
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: right; margin-top: 40px; font-style: italic">
          Don’t worry, I don’t hate you like you do me, ’Cause my love was
          greater than the one you will ever see…
