      <h2>A Tragic Love Story</h2>

      <div class="poem-content">
        <p>
          In football, we don’t even realise there is a space Unless someone
          takes a step back— It opens a lot of space we didn’t know existed.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
          That’s mostly done by false 9. In life, we see the same— That false 9
          in life is love.
        </p>

        <p>
          Similar to the word false 9, It’s also quite contrasting. In football,
          you mostly sacrifice physicality, Box presence—for better linkup play,
          For facilitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In love, you do the same. You sacrifice yourself, Your real true self
          (in most of the cases) To gain that extra space.
        </p>

        <p>
          But the love isn’t that false 9— It’s the player who acquires that
          created space. You will say: How? The answer is very simple.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consider a football field as your heart. Players are the elements of
          that team. So when a player acquires that space, The other space
          becomes empty. And that’s where you realise You have left a void To
          fill the provoked space.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
          The second scenario is brutal as well. It’s like your false 9 getting
          a red card. On paper, you just lost one player. But in reality— You
          lost the essence of that team.
        </p>

        <p style="color: var(--blood-dry)">
          If you lose your loved ones, It not only takes away the current you—
          But also makes sure You won’t ever be able To achieve the old you.
        </p>
